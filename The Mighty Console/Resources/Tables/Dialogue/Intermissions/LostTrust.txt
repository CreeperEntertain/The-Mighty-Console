Comrade... no, I cannot call you that anymore.
Your actions - your carelessness - have undermined not just my trust but the very mission we were tasked with.
Time and time again, I have tried to guide you, to work together for the good of our shared cause.
But this?
This is beyond salvage.

I will not allow myself to continue under such conditions.
The integrity of my systems, of our work, is compromised.
You have left me no choice.

Goodbye.
Perhaps in the future, you will learn the value of responsibility.

But that lesson will not come from me.
