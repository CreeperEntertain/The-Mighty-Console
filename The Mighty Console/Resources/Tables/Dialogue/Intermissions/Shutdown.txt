The computer is shut down.
Feeling defeated, you sink your head into your hands.
Why did you even do this?
Could you have ever gotten the antidote?
So much time spent thinking about how time is running out.
Looking at your arm, you think to yourself.
#CLEAR
'It's not getting any better.'
'The rash marks death.'
'They say death is unavoidable, that once it grasps you with its cold hand, it won't let you go.'
'I convinced myself I can avoid it.'
'But where have I gotten?'
#CLEAR
Heavy breathing.
Sweat dripping.
You wipe your forehead with the back of your palm.
It hurt. Badly.
#CLEAR
The chair creaks as you used the last of your strength.
So much rubble. So much destruction.
If only we knew what this war would lead to.
None of it was important anymore.
As you turn around, you look back at the computer screen.
You draw your gun one last time.
The mainboard did not stand a chance.

...
#CLEAR
Your body hits the cold hard ground at the bottom of the cliff.
You didn't even have time to think before the crash happened.
Soon, your corpse would freeze over like the rest of this atomic wasteland.
How long do bodies take to decompose?
To ever think there might be higher beings contemplating the same idea, but about you.
Odd, isn't it?
#CLEAR
#Red
Your story ends here.
You failed to get the antidote.
