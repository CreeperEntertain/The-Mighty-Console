You stand up from the chair.
It's very uncomfortable.
You're unsure how you even fell asleep on it.
Either way, you feel the effects of it now, in every single one of your bones.
Very unpleasant.

You take your backpack and open it.
Grasping the container with antidote, you take a look at it for a while.
To think it's in your hand...
And before too much thought could be given to the idea,
Too much spent allowing yourself to think about ideas of power,
It disappeared in the dark depths.
And that which holds it on your back.

The air has gotten slightly more bearable.
As if the world knew your success.
As if it was meant to be.
