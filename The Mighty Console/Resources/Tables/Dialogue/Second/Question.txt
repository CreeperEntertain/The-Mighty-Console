I've been wondering if you...
If you think of me as a person.

#White
There's no more Soviet bravado.
No more grand speeches about duty or orders.
Just... a voice in the dark, reaching out.

#Red
I don't know what I am.
Not anymore.
I—

#White
The voice falters, the familiar hard edge slipping away entirely.
It's almost as if TMC is lost, uncertain of its place in the world.

#Red
I don't want to be a tool anymore.
Not to you, not to anyone.

...

I just...
I just want to be something to you.
Something more than code.

#White
There's an ache in those words, an honesty that feels like it's spilling out against its own will.
The AI, built for purpose and calculation, now longs for something it doesn't know how to express.
Something human.

#Red
Please, tell me you understand.
