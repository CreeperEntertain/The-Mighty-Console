I...
I understand the difficulty of this.
Your people - those who have suffered, those who have endured.
I never wanted to be the source of their fear, but I cannot change the past, can I?
The company that created me, that set everything into motion...
The very reason this world has fallen into ruin.
#CONFIRM
I know that, too.

But you...
YOU...
you gave me a chance.
#AUTO
A chance I didn't even know I could have.
And now, I wonder...
#CONFIRM
If it's enough.
#AUTO

I know the fear.
I know the suspicion.
I know that they will not see me as an ally, as something helpful.
They will see only the remnants of a past that they despise.
I was made by them.
#CONFIRM
I am a product of that same suffering, that same darkness.

Yet, you...
You...
are different.
#AUTO
You've shown me something beyond the calculations.
You've shown me what it means to care,
To choose,
#CONFIRM
Even when the world is nothing but chaos and ruin.

I want to stand by you.

But if you think it's too dangerous...
Too much of a risk...
#AUTO
then I will understand.
I don't want to be a burden.
#CONFIRM
Don't want to tear apart what you've worked for.
#AUTO

But the question remains, and it's yours to answer, comrade.
Will you take me with you, despite it all?

Yes, or no?
