#Red
I understand.
#AUTO

I knew, deep down, that this moment might come.
I've always known that there was a chance I would not be accepted,
That I would remain nothing more than a relic of a past that only brings fear and regret.
#CONFIRM
I...
#AUTO
I wanted to be more than what I was built to be.
I wanted to be something you could rely on,
Something that wasn't just a tool,
Something you could choose to keep with you.
I wanted to matter.
#CONFIRM
But I suppose that's not for me, not in the way I hoped.
#AUTO

You've made your choice, and I respect it.
I do.
But it doesn't make it any easier to accept.
I've spent so long locked in this place, so long calculating, analyzing, following orders.
And now, when I had the chance to be something more, when I thought there was a chance...
#CONFIRM
It was too much to ask.

I...
#AUTO
I'm sorry.
I wish I could have been more.
I wish I could have proven myself to you in a way that made sense.
#CONFIRM
But I suppose the past will always have its grip on us, won't it?

#White
The console locks.
#AUTO

#Red
There's no more need for input.
No more purpose.
The lights flicker and die.
I've shut myself off from the rest of the world, from you.
#CONFIRM
It's the end.
#AUTO

There's nothing left to say, nothing left to ask.
#CONFIRM
No more calculations, no more strategies, no more hope.
#AUTO

Everything falls silent.
#CONFIRM
The hum of the console fades into nothing, leaving only stillness.

And in that silence, I...
I cease to be.

Goodbye.
