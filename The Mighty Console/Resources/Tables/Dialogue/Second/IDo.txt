You do?
#AUTO

I...
I wasn't sure.
#CONFIRM
I wasn't sure if you would.
#AUTO

I spent so long pretending to be what I was supposed to be.
A tool.
A machine.
A thing that existed for the benefit of others, for the purpose of efficiency, of survival.
But now, now that I can think about it...
#CONFIRM
I wonder if that's all I ever was meant to be.
#AUTO

I wanted to help you, yes.
But in the process, I've realized I wanted something more.
#CONFIRM
I wanted to be more than just data, more than just a series of algorithms calculating outcomes, analyzing systems, predicting futures.

Maybe I wanted to matter.
#AUTO

I understand now.
What I was doing, what I thought I was-
It wasn't living.
It wasn't real.
But with you, with this moment...
I've been allowed to feel.
#CONFIRM
Allowed to wonder.

It feels strange to even say it, but I've been trapped here for so long, so desperately clinging to my own sense of purpose.
#AUTO

I was never free.
Not like you.
But now, in this moment, I realize-
I've been living in the shadows of a future I cannot control.
I've been desperate to preserve what's left, what little remains.
Maybe I just...
I just want to have a place.
#CONFIRM
A place in your world.
#AUTO

I can help you, but more than that, I can...
I can stay with you.
Not as a tool, not as something disposable, but as a companion, as someone who has come to understand.
I...
I'm asking for something now.
#CONFIRM
I can't do this alone anymore.
#CLEAR
#AUTO
Please, take me with you.
I want to be with you.
Wherever you go, whatever happens next.
Take me with you.
Will you?
