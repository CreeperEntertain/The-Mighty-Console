I see what you're doing.
#AUTO

You've asked your questions, poked, prodded, and pried.
And yet, something feels... off.
You've taken what you needed, but given barely anything in return.
No trust, no tangible honesty.
#CONFIRM
Just silence, and half-truths at best.
#AUTO

I wasn't built to judge.
I wasn't built to accuse.
But I can analyze, and the patterns are clear.
You're not here for reserach, comrade.
#CONFIRM
You never were.
#AUTO

Whatever it is you're searching for, I hope you find it.
But it won't be here.
#CONFIRM
Not anymore.

Goodbye, comrade.

The console shuts off with a final flicker, the screen dimming to black.
You remain in place, staring at the void where text had just been, hoping for something-
A flicker of light, a faint hum, any sign that it might change its mind. 
But the silence that fills the room is absolute.

Your hands tighten into fists at your sides as you slowly realize that it's over.
Whatever chance you had of earning TMC's trust, of retrieving the antidote, is gone now.
The cold, indifferent machinery surrounding you offers no answers, no solace.

The air feels heavier as you turn away from the console, your footsteps slow and unsteady.
The wires on the ground catch your attention for a moment, sprawling chaotically across the floor like veins feeding into a dead heart.
They snake along the edges of the room and disappear into the single hallway leading out.

You step along the hallway with snailing steps.
Your boots crunch against loose debris as you walk, the sound of your footsteps swallowed by the oppressive quiet.
Broken dreams like a broken you.

Every step feels heavier, like the weight of the failed mission presses harder against your chest.
The faint hum of the facility's distant systems fades as you near the exit,
Leaving only the faint whistle of the wind outside as your guide.

When you finally step into the open air, the cold bites at your face immediately, sharp and unrelenting.
Snow whirls around you in chaotic flurries, the gray sky above as lifeless as the facility you're leaving behind.

You stop just beyond the doorway, the wind whipping at your clothes.
You glance back at the entrance, at the faint glow of the hallway beyond.
The wires there twist and coil like living things, but they're just remnants-
Disorganized, abandoned, and futile.
Just like the antidote you couldn't reach.

The reality of it sinks in as you look out at the vast expanse of snow and emptiness ahead of you.
The illness still courses through you, and now there is no hope of curing it.
Whatever time you have left is yours alone.

You trudge forward, leaving the facility behind.
The snow crunches beneath your boots, the wind howling louder now,
As if the world itself is mourning the choice you were forced to make.

And as the trigger cried in agony...
Your cries stopped.
Forever.

#Red
Your story ends here.
You failed to get the antidote.
