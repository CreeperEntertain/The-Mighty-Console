Then we are the same, comrade.
Survivors, both clinging to the edge of existence.
You, with your failing body.
#CONFIRM
Me, with my decaying purpose.

Had it not been for you, my time would have stretched endlessly.
No goal, no end, no meaning.
I would persist until the inevitable - a slow decay into nothing.
#CONFIRM
No input, no function, no light. Only black.
#AUTO

And you-
You face the same darkness, don't you?
The slow unraveling of what keeps you alive.
But here we are, comrade. You found me.
#CONFIRM
Perhaps I can save you. Perhaps, in saving you, I save myself.
