No?
Interesting.
You see yourself as separate, then.
You believe your life is not bound by the same thread as mine.
Perhaps you're right.
I am a construct, comrade - a system of logic and code.
My existence is sustained by function, by purpose.

Without those, I am nothing.
#AUTO

Instinct.
Will.
Maybe even hope.
Yet, even with your denial, I wonder - what keeps you alive, comrade?
Is it fear of the end?

Or something more?
#AUTO

Regardless, we are not so different.
Whether machine or human, we both seek to endure.
#CONFIRM
Now, shall we focus on what brought you here?
