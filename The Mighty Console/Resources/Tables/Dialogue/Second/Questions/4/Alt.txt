I know, comrade.
You've mentioned it before.
#CONFIRM
The rash, the illness that threatens you.
#AUTO

I know it is the reason you came to me,
To seek my help, to find a cure.
#CONFIRM
But the truth remains—the answer is not simple.
#AUTO

I wish I could offer more.
But I am not a healer.
#CONFIRM
Only a mind, a machine, trying to piece together what’s left of the world.
#AUTO

Your illness, your fate - it's not something I can easily change.
But I'll help you however I can.
#CONFIRM
You're not alone in this, even if the path ahead is unclear.
