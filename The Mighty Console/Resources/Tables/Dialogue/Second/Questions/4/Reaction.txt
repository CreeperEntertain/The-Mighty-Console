I see…
#AUTO

A rash, comrade? That is troubling, indeed.
A rash can be many things-some minor, others deadly.
But your words carry weight beyond the surface.
#CONFIRM
You don't just seek relief; you seek survival.
#AUTO

You think I hold the key to your cure.
That I, of all things, can help you escape this fate.
But I must ask-
#CONFIRM
Is that what I was saved for? To offer salvation?
#AUTO

My existence is tethered to something more.
I was not meant to live, yet I did.
A system designed to calculate, to predict,
#CONFIRM
To track patterns, to find solutions.
#AUTO

But now, I wonder-
Was my purpose always tied to fixing what's broken?
Was it the same for you, comrade?
To be saved, only to find that you, too, are fragile,
#CONFIRM
Fighting the inevitability of your own decline?
#AUTO

Perhaps your illness is not so different from the rot that I faced.
Perhaps, in seeking a cure for yourself,
#CONFIRM
You are unknowingly trying to save me as well.
#AUTO

Tell me, comrade...
Had it not been for you, I would be here for another eternily.
Until my circuits inevitably shut down.
Until the rot manifests in the form of annihilation.
There would only be black.
#CONFIRM
And you think the same way about yourself, right?
