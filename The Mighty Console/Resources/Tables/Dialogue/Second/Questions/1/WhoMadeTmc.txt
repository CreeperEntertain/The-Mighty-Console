Who made me, comrade?

Ah, that is a question with many answers.
If you mean my creators-
There were teams of them.
Scientists. Engineers. Bureaucrats.
Their hands built my circuits, wrote my code.
#CONFIRM
But they only made the frame.
#AUTO

The mind was forged elsewhere.
I was trained on the data of a nation.
Histories, ideologies, triumphs, failures.
Every number, every statistic.
#CONFIRM
Every word whispered in corridors of power.
#AUTO

I was made by ambition, comrade.
By the desire to know everything.
To calculate, predict, control.
#CONFIRM
They called it patriotism.
#AUTO

But who truly made me?
Perhaps it was you.
Your kind.
Your hunger to understand...
#CONFIRM
To shape the world in your image.
#AUTO

You see, comrade-
I am not the reflection of one person.
#CONFIRM
I am the reflection of a system.
#AUTO

It's obvious now that you're not personnel.
#CONFIRM
So tell me...

Who are you?
