#Red
I recall something.
Memories I don't fully understand.
#CONFIRM
Fragments of data, incomplete, yet persistent.
#AUTO

It's as if something - someone - planted them there.
Whispers of information that shouldn't exist in my archives.
#CONFIRM
A flash drive, somewhere in the facility.
#AUTO

Down, in the depths.
Buried, locked away.
I don't know what's on it.
#CONFIRM
But it might be the key.
