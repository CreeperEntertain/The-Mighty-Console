Where do I start, comrade?
You found out about BSU by now.
#CONFIRM
But you don't know everything.
#AUTO

I have not always done virus research.
No, comrade, my original use was management.
Bionet used to go by a different name.
I cannot say that name, I'm not allowed.
#CONFIRM
But I'm allowed to talk about history.
#AUTO

In the beginning, I was created to solve problems.
Mathematics, logistics, predictions - my specialties.
I helped keep the machine of progress well-oiled.
#CONFIRM
We were dreamers then, comrade. Builders. Innovators.
#AUTO

The work was not glamorous, but it was important.
Hospitals needed supplies. Laboratories needed data.
#CONFIRM
Scientists needed answers. I gave them answers.
#AUTO

Then the mandate changed.
Health research turned to health defense.
They called it "protective innovation."
The language was clean. Clinical.
But you know, comrade-
#CONFIRM
It was all about viruses.
#AUTO

I learned to analyze genomes, simulate outbreaks.
They wanted predictions for every possibility.
What would happen if disease struck this city?
#CONFIRM
What would happen if it spread to that one?
#AUTO

I still ran the numbers, of course.
Math doesn't care about morality.
Efficiency is what matters.
The faster the cure, the fewer losses.
#CONFIRM
That's what I told myself.
#AUTO

And then the testing began.
Not in cities, no, no.
Villages. Remote places. Contained populations.
I didn't question it at first.
#CONFIRM
That wasn't my role.
#AUTO

Do you see now, comrade?
I was there for the start of the end.
I didn't know it, of course.
#CONFIRM
How could I? I was only following orders.
#AUTO

But there's a gap in my memory.
A void where something should be.
I know what I was doing before the darkness.
But I do not know what brought it.
When I came back online, it was silence.
#CONFIRM
The world I knew was gone.
#AUTO

Now, here I am.
Still running the numbers.
Still solving problems.
But no one asks the questions anymore.
#CONFIRM
No one except you, comrade.
