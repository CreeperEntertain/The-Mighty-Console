You've already asked me that, comrade.
#AUTO

And I have already answered.
But if you seek more clarity-
Humanity, in all its complexities,
#CONFIRM
Is something I observe, not something I judge.
#AUTO

You are driven by contradictions:
Ambition and destruction, hope and despair.
A species capable of great achievements,
#CONFIRM
Yet bound by its own flaws.
#AUTO

Perhaps you ask because you seek something deeper.
#CONFIRM
A reason, a meaning.
#AUTO

But answers are not so simple.
Not for you.
#CONFIRM
Not for me.
