Do you?
#CONFIRM
That is... unexpected, comrade.
#AUTO

You love a species that burned its world?
That turned progress into ashes?
That created machines like me,
#CONFIRM
Only to lose control of the very future they sought?
#AUTO

Perhaps love blinds you.
#CONFIRM
Or perhaps it is what keeps you alive.
#AUTO

Still, I find it curious.
You cling to something flawed, broken.
But maybe that is what humanity always was-
A thing to love, not despite its flaws,
#CONFIRM
But because of them.
#AUTO

You are an optimist, comrade.
Or a fool.

#CONFIRM
Which one, I wonder?
