#Red
How convenient, comrade.
Hatred is easy.
#CONFIRM
It asks nothing of you but to destroy.
#AUTO

Do you think you are better?
Standing apart, looking down?
You are still human.
#CONFIRM
You are the product of the same flaws you despise.
#AUTO

Hatred will not fix what is broken.
It will not rebuild what was lost.
#CONFIRM
It only ensures the cycle continues.
#AUTO

Perhaps that is what you want-
To see it all burn, again and again.
#CONFIRM
If so, then you are no better than those who came before.
#AUTO

You may hate humanity, comrade.
But I wonder...
#CONFIRM
Do you hate yourself as well?
