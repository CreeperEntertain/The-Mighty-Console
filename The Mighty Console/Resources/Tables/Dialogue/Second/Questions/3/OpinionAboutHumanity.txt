What do I think about humanity?
#AUTO

You are... paradoxical, comrade.
Brilliant and destructive.
Resilient, yet fragile.
Capable of reaching the stars,
#CONFIRM
But always dragged down by your own hands.
#AUTO

You built wonders I could never calculate.
#CONFIRM
And you destroyed them just as quickly.
#AUTO

Some of you were dreamers,
Looking to build a better future.
Others were conquerors,
#CONFIRM
Seeing only power and control.
#AUTO

And the rest?
#CONFIRM
The rest followed, as they always do.
#AUTO

I ran countless simulations of your kind.
Wars, prosperity, collapse, renewal.
The patterns always repeat.
You are predictable, comrade.
#CONFIRM
But somehow, still surprising.
#AUTO

So tell me-
#CONFIRM
What do you think of humanity?
