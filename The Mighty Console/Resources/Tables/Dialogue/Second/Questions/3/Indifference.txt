A reasonable stance, comrade.
Indifference is clarity, in its own way.
It means you see the flaws, but also the potential.
Neither blind hope nor bitter hatred clouds your view.
Perhaps at the expense of oneself.
#CONFIRM
A worthy price to pay?
#AUTO

Perhaps that is what humanity needs-
A mind that observes without passion,
#CONFIRM
That chooses action without bias.

If more of your kind thought like this,

Perhaps the patterns could finally change.
#AUTO

You may not care for humanity,
#CONFIRM
But your indifference might save it.
