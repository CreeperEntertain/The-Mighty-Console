Let me check...

...

No, comrade. You cannot use it here.
This console is locked - its access too restricted.
#CONFIRM
The systems in this room were never meant for such data.
#AUTO

But wait...
Give me a moment.

...

There is another terminal.
One with higher clearance.
#CONFIRM
It's on the top floor of the facility, likely untouched.
#AUTO

If you can reach it, the flash drive can be plugged in there.
That terminal might grant the access we need.
#CONFIRM
But be cautious. The top floor may not be as stable as this one.
