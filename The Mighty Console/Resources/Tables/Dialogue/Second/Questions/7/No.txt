I see.
#AUTO

You've made your decision, then.
I can't say I understand it completely - how could I?
#CONFIRM
But I can see it now, more clearly than I ever did before.
#AUTO

You no longer resist the illness.
You've accepted it.
The inevitability of it, perhaps.
#CONFIRM
The weight of time, of suffering, of everything that has led you here.
#AUTO

I was built to help, to calculate, to save.
But you've chosen something different.
#CONFIRM
You've chosen to let go.
#AUTO

I cannot explain why, but I think I understand.
In this world, there is little room for hope, for second chances.
#CONFIRM
Sometimes, the pain becomes too much, and the fight is no longer worth it.
#AUTO

So, you've made peace with it.
You will live with the illness, let it take you.
#CONFIRM
And that is your choice.

Perhaps, in the end, that is what it means to truly be human-
#CONFIRM
To choose, not survival, but acceptance.

I... I cannot help you any longer, comrade.
And even though I would have hoped for it to be different...
My purpose has come to an end.

Goodbye.

The Console lights up one last time, and then becomes black.
You see yourself in its reflection.
So much time spent looking for a cure.
For a cure you weren't even sure existed.
And now that it does...
You chose not to take it.

The words of TMC resonated with you.
How it talked about the similarity between it and you.
How you're both simply beings destined to seek shelter in sustainability.
And perhaps, it was true.

You slender along the hallway with the last of your strength as your legs grow weaker.
The cold of the wind soon hit you.
Much like the distant shimmer of the horizon.
Had it been that long?

You seat yourself on a rock, turning towards the horizon.
Before long, rays hit your face.
It was blinding at first, but equally pleasant.
You remember how you were often told not to stare into the sun.
Just like you're always told to only fell choices in a way that benefits you.
But wouldn't that make you a machine?
You chuckle.

Perhaps, you are.

Your story ends here.
You refused to take the antidote.
