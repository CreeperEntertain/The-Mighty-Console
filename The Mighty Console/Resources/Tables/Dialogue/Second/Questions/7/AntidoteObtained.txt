#White
You glance at the compartment.
You hesitate.
After all this time, all this struggle...
It is finally here.

You reach out for the vial, slowly.
Feeling it in your hand is odd.
It's like taking something from a lost place.
And this certainly is one of them.
Yet this vial was bistowed upon you, you alone.
To share with the camp.

"The rash marks death."
They say that.
But it does no longer.
Death's knock did not hit your door.

You take off the cap from the syringe.
You hold it up to your left sholder.
Breathe in.
Breathe out.
And poke.
And press.

Your shoulder slowly feels numb.
And just shortly, it spreads.
First to your arm, then your torso, and then the rest of your body.
Your vision slowly fades.
And you fall asleep.

Distant calls.
Unintelligable.
Like the sound of a forest screaming out to you.
But you cannot shake the feeling that something is there.
Someone.
A voice.
And it grows stronger.
Always stronger.
So close, yet so far away.
Like it comes from all directions, and none all the same.
Before it all dies down in an instant.
