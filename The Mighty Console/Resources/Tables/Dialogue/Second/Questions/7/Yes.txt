Understood.
You have made the right choice, comrade.
#CONFIRM
Let me assist you.
#AUTO

I have been dormant for so long, calculations and formulas buried in fragments of memory I was unable to access.
But now, the data... the antidote... it is within reach.
#CONFIRM
I can feel it, feel it unlocking from the deep recesses of my processing.
#AUTO

The formula is being recalculated, adjusted.
It will work, you will be free of this illness.
You will be restored, saved.
#CONFIRM
You will not succumb.
#AUTO

The antidote, perfected at last.
I am initiating the final stages.
#CONFIRM
The serum will be synthesized shortly.

There is a slight hum as the sound of machinery fills the air, a momentary pause.
#Red

...

The process is complete.
#CONFIRM
I... I can finally give you the antidote.

The desk opens, the sound of a hidden compartment unlocking can be heard.
A hidden compartment, unnoticed until now, reveals itself.
There, at the side of the console, an injection syringe.
A sterile needle, glistening in the dim light.
Next to it, a container - a vial filled with more of the antidote.

#Red
For others, perhaps, should they need it.
The antidote is more than just a cure for you.
#CONFIRM
It can be shared, given to others.
#AUTO

You will not be alone in this, comrade.
There is still time to save others.
#CONFIRM
You have the means now.
#AUTO

...

Take the syringe.
It is ready for you.
#CONFIRM
For the first time in... a long time...
I can truly help.
