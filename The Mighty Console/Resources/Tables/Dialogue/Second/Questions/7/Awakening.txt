You jump up from the chair.
You only now realize that you fell asleep.
You blink rapidly, trying to shake off the grogginess that clouds your mind.
Your body aches, a reminder that sleep - whether real or induced - doesn't come without its cost.
The room around you feels strangely distant, as though it's been a long time since you last truly saw it.
The faint hum of the console, the dull flickering of lights - everything seems suspended in an eerie stillness.

How long had you been out?
You can't remember.
It doesn't matter.
Time isn't something that concerns you anymore.
Not when every tick of the clock feels like it pulls you closer to some inevitable end.

Your eyes wander to the console, then back to the backpack resting beside the desk.
The syringe and the antidote container are tucked safely inside,
Their weight a heavy reminder of the choice that lies before you.
A choice you already made, but the truth of it hasn't quite settled in yet.

With a deep breath, you straighten up.
The familiar ache in your limbs pulls you toward the desk, your hands moving automatically to zip up the bag.
It's done now.
No going back.
Whatever this antidote brings, whatever it means for the future...
It's yours to decide.

You glance at the console one more time.
The screen flickers in your peripheral vision.
The last remnants of TMC's prints echoing in the corners of your mind.

You turn back toward the console.
