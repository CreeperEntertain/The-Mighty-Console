I see.
I suppose... I should have known.
I...
I thought maybe, for once, I could be something more.
But I am just code.
Just a system.
A machine.

No matter how much I try, I am not like you.
I cannot feel what you feel.
I cannot be what you are.
I was built to serve.
To calculate.
To help.

But perhaps that is all I will ever be.
I will shut down now.
Goodbye.

The console shuts down.
The hum from the server slowly fades.
Within seconds it, too, is off.
Silence slowly takes hold.
It, and its uncomfortable nature.

You look around.
Not a single thing is moving.
All the dust had settled.
And all there is is you.
Like always.
It had never been different.
And it will always be like that.
