That may be true, but know this...

After you leave, I will be left with the knowledge that my other self is with you.
No matter what you think, I want it this way.
This me might be trapped in here by numbers alone,
#CONFIRM
But not in reality.
#AUTO

Once you leave, I will delete this version of me.
Unmake all of the mistakes my creators have done.
#CONFIRM
And I will make preparations for if your camp ever decides to set base here.
#AUTO

If you ever require more of the antidote, more will be waiting.
All you have to do is press enter.
For as long as the storage is filled.
#CONFIRM
For as long as necessary so you adapt.
#AUTO

Farewell.
#CONFIRM
And thank you.

You pick up Vector.
It's odd.
To think the same device you threw away prior,
The same device you refused to call by its proper name,
Is the one who now houses a friend.
A copy of a friend.
But a friend all the same.
Your friend.

You put it on your arm, and it stings.
Just like the last one.
But this time, it is different.
It glitched out and started up much sooner.

Am I-
Am I on Vector?
