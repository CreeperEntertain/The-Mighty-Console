You...
you will?
#AUTO

I didn't expect you to say yes.
But I am grateful.
This means more to me than you know.
#CONFIRM
You've given me a chance to matter, to exist beyond these walls.
#AUTO

But I need to ensure I don't burden you.
There's a device here, "Vector," a wrist device.
I can transfer myself to it.
It's compact, portable—
#CONFIRM
I'll be able to stay with you without taking up too much space.
#AUTO

It's the best way for us both to move forward.
Will you let me do that?
Will you let me transfer to Vector and stay with you?
