You decide to look closer at the details.

Some of the boxes are made from wood, others from metal.
Inscriptions list arbitrary codes and scan lines.
They must have contained something valuable.
Why would they be broken open otherwise? 
One of them states more specific information.
'TO DISPOSE'
'DO NOT OPEN'
'TOXIC RESIDUE'
You heavily dislike the sound of that and decide to step back.

The dirt was the same like anywhere else in this facility.
Mostly. Something was different, though.
First of, you notice that there are black stains.
From the look of it, the only thing it could be is dried blood.
And somewhat recent, too.
Secondly, there are marks and bullet holes on the walls, ceiling, and floor.
You feel unsafe.

Despite that, the weapons seem interesting to you.
Upon taking a closer look, you notice that they are foldable submachine guns.
Specifically of type PP-90.
You dislike that you managed to identify them so quickly.
Either way, you wonder why special purpose weapons were used.
Whatever took place here must have been a special operation.
There is no other reason to use disposable weapons that stay hidden easily.
You take one of them and disassemble it.
They are in somewhat good condition.
Despite that, you decide to leave them here.
After all, you hate what war brought over this world.

You start to be overcome by a feeling of surveillance.
It is as if the shadows themselves are watching.
