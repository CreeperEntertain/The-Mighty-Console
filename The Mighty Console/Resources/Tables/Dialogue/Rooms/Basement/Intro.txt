The lights are off.
You almost decide not to enter, but shine your light.
After realizing there is a light switch, you turn on the lamps.
The basement lies before you revealed.

A bunch of boxes, all broken open.
Grime, dust, and ash.
Indescribable black stains.
Discarded weapons and empty ammunition.
Something must have went down here.
