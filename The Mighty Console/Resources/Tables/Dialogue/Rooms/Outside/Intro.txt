You make your way outside.
The air had gotten much colder.
Under normal circumstances, it would have been unpleasant, but now?
Maybe, it is the fact that you finally found the place you were looking for, but it felt... nice.
You can't describe it.
It's like the wind is biting you and dozens of needles hit your face.
Yet still, it feels nice.

You look around the area.

The first thing that meets your eyes is the path you had come from.
Walking back now would not make sense.
But it makes you think.
Should you have destroyed the device?
Surely, you know how to get back. Your spatial awareness is great.
But oddly, it gave company.
And you tossed it away like rubbish.
It's like you still hear its faint voice.

The second vista was the cliff.
It is about thirty feet away from you.
You had never actually climbed a mountain.
Risking a look surely couldn't be wrong?
