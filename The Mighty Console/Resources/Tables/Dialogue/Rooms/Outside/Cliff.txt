You decide to approach the cliff.
As you reach there, your steps become smaller and smaller.
At first, it seemed like it would be beautiful. And from a distance, it surely was.
The almost completely dim light of what's left of nightfall seemed so beautiful.
They still do, but you start to become filled with another feeling.

Absolute, unrivaled, terror.

You realize now just how afraid you are of heights.
It was like an eternity until you reached the cliff's end.
You stand there, two steps back from its tip.
You cannot think.
You do not want to think.
Thinking might cause you to fall.

You had come so far.
Mistakes are the last thing that should be on your mind.
Avoid them at all cost.
That's what you always tell yourself.
But was it true, or rather just a distraction?
To think someone would do something mindless in these times.
Unheard of. Shame.To be shunned.Thrown off this very cliff. Shot dead. With your gun.

...

You take off your armband.
You never liked it anyway.
With a very odd sensation, you inch closer to the end.
You almost want to hold your hand out. And try.
You instantly decide to toss it instead.

You instantly step back and throw your chest onto the ground.
That way, you feel more comfortable pushing yourself closer.
With your head over the edge, you look down.
Void fills the drop. The band consumed before you had a chance to look.

You spend another few eon - felt seconds staring down in disbelief before you push yourself back.
With feet back on solid ground, you think to yourself.
'Who would build in a place like this?'
'This is terrifying.'
'This shouldn't be here.I shouldn't be here.'
But you are.

You make your way back to the door.
