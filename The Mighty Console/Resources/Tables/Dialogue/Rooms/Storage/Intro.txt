You enter the storage.
You don't know what you expected, but certainly not this.
Shelves everywhere, with bits of machinery and boxes scattered on them.
Building material as well as various tools and bits, too.

One of the racks looks as if it might fall any moment.
You feel devious and take a rock to throw at it.
It collapses.
You are unsure what you expected.
