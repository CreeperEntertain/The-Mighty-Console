You aren't sure if there is anything here.
After all, it's simply a storage hall for materials.
But you decide to look anyway.

Scrambling through boxes, you find a few useful tools.
Namely a blowtorch with fuel, an automatic screwdriver, and a hammer.
You don't know whether these tools might come in handy, yet you decide to take them, still.
But that isn't the only thing you find.

When looking deeper around the edges of the hall, you notice that part of the wall is damaged.
Curious, you push the rack in front of it aside.
There is a note inside it, but it's too far inside the crevice to reach.
If you attempt to, you could probably still read it.
Had you only looked around this part of the hall a second less, you had probably missed it.
