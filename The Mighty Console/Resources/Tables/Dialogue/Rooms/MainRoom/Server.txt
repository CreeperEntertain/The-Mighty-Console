You approach the server rack.
Lights flickering.
Parts humming.

The dancing flashes on the rack remind you of cities.
During the day, they would look bland and hideous.
But at night?
It was a lightshow.
Towers, reaching for the skies like lances.
Hundreds and thousands of people inside them.
But now?
They're all gone.
You feel a bit disheartened.

You take a closer look.
Cables, like anywhere else, are runnining rampant.
It is a bit hard to look inside, but all you see is machine parts.
Even around the back and on the sides is nothing.
It seems like there is nothing here.
