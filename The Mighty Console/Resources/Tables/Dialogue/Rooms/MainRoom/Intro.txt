You decide to take a closer look at the room this time.
Just like any other space, the floor is covered in debris.
You observe a rat run out into the entrance hall and leave the facility.
It must have stayed here due to the cold.
Come to think of it, you realize that it's almost room temperature.
Maybe, the new outpost could be set up here?
You snap out of it and look around again.

The first thing you look at is the humming server.
Maybe, there is something there?
The next thing you look at is the hallway you came from.
Still looks as crappy as before.
Lastly, you notice something new you did not before.
Most of the doors are locked off shut. They do not make the impression of ever opening.
However, there is a sign on a wall in the distance.
You take a look at the sign.
'UP: ############' The rest was unredable. Damage covered the text.
'RIGHT: Storage'
'DOWN: Basement'

Stepping back from the sign, you notice that the doors to all three rooms are unlocked.
Not just unlocked, they had forcefully been broken open.
Either way, you step back and think.
