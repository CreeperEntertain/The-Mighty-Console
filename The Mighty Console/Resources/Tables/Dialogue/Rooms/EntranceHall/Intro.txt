It's the place you simply walked through before.
You decide to inspect the place more thoroughly now.

Dust covers the walls.
Normally, concrete doesn't reveal grime that clearly.
Especially not concrete as rough as this.
But even that subsides.
You run your finger along one of the horizontal seams on the wall.
There is a thick film on it.
Some indescribable mass of gunk, oil-like residue, dust, and ash.
You decide to hit the wall with your hand. Lots of dust flies up into the air.
You start coughing.
That probably wasn't a good idea.

Another thing you see is a braker box.
It is wide open. Fuses are all missing but one which itself was destroyed.
You again think to yourself how this place has power.
Clearly, it could not come from the grid as it no longer existed.
You eventually push this thought aside.

There is an additional frame that looks like a door had been there.
All that is left now is paint coated brickwork.
You pick up a piece of rubble and try breaking through.
The only visible damage is slight carvings.
You feel stupid for even trying.

The only other sight is the door you used to get into the facility.
The sight is eerily terrifying.
It's a heavy, open door that completely contrasts the design of the hallway.
Where you can clearly make out walls, ceiling, and floor due to the pale fluorescent lighting, all you see through the door is complete, solid, all consuming blackness.
Had it really gotten that late?
You quickly throw one last glance in both directions before thinking again.
