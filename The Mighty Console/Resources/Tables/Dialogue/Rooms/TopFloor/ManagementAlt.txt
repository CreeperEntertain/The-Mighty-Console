You approach the door.
The closer you get to it, the clearer the room behind it appears to get.
Maybe it is simply a placebo.
But it doesn't matter.
You grab the handle and try to open.
It doesn't work. The door is shut.
You try again, this time more strongly.
The door gives off a nasty cracking sound and finally opens.
You do not expect it and fall inside with it.

If you thought the rest of this facility was silent, this room definitely is.
Sound padding decorates the walls' upper half.
The lower padded in insulation and wood.
What appears to be the head's office looks surprisingly clean.
As if you snapped and they jzst disappeared.

You get off your feet and brush the dust off your jeans.
Yet another desk.
Nothing on it, but it looks fancy.
Probably ebony wood.
And decorated with metal elements.
There definitely was a difference in status between whoever worked here and whoever directed this place.

A black leather seat stands behind the desk.
Sitting on it causes a clicking sound to come from the desk.
The drawer opened again.
Inside are only the remains of your cigar extravaganza.
Seeing it reminds you of decay.

Upon standing back up, the drawer closes.
You don't give it too much of a thought and go for the door.
With one last look back to the desk, you leave.
Once outside again, you move the door back into place, or rather attempt to.
It turns out you have to pull it with force.
But it's closed now.
And you back in the middle of the room.
