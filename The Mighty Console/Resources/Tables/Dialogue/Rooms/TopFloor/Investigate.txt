You decide to take a closer look at this room.

All of the notes on the tables look similar to the ones one level below.
But there are some differences.
Because instead of listing chemical formulas and text written by hand, they are all printed.
Lots of machine - code - like ramblings.
Random strings and alphanumeric number combinations.
Like a test print to check a printer's performance.
But it could obviously not be that.
There is nothing specifically noteworthy about these papers, so you turn to the machines.

They are indescribable.
Like someone mashed together random parts to build what they think makes sense.
These are pillars set into the walls with random spacing.
Lots of shapes decorate them.
All of them are encased by glass.
You knock against the glass and are confused.
Unlike regular glass, your knocks do not reverberate. Not even slightly.
It's more like knocking against stone.
You dislike it.

The central machine is similar in design, but different in scale.
It is also not encased in glass.
There are definite similarities to a computer, but that would not do it justice.
It's more like a behemoth.
An elephant in a room.
But in black and made from metal and plastic.

You approach the screen on the machine.
It is off, but upon touching it, it wakes up.
All you see on it is random text.
You considered calling it junk data, but it's probably used for something.
Attempting to write in code resulted in an error.
Before breaking anything, you decide to step back.
