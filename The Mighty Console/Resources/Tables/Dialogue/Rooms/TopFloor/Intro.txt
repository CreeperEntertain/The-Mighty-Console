You arrive on the top floor.
It looks surprisingly different to the rest of the facility.
A few things to notice are the frames of what you assume to be employees, as well as the odd machinery.
The parts of the wall you are able to see are decorated with white ceramic tiles.
The ceiling itself is coated in a popcorn texture.
This god awful type ceiling you used to see everywhere.
And hate.

Just like the room below, there are desks separated across the room, although fewer.
They themselves remain mostly intact and untouched.
And the contents largely consist of files and folders.
Working here must have been boring.

You could not describe the machines placed along the walls for the most part.
They are all connected to a central one via wires.
Those wires again.
The central machine has a monitor.
But before interacting with it, you notice something else.

On the opposite side of the room, there is a door.
It wasn't like the rest of the doors, but made from wood instead.
Odd to see a regular apartment door in a lab like this one.
You can't make out what's behind it directly.
The glass dispersed the light.
There was a sign next to the door.
It reads 'MANAGEMENT.'

You feel more lost than before.
