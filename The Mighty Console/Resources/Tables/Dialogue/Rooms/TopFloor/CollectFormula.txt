The big moment.
You approach the central machine again.
You enter the code TMC gave you.
This time, it would not be invalid.
And it isn't.

It takes a few seconds to start, but once it does, lines of code run through the screen at blazing speeds.
The pillars around the central machine now also started to work.
Some of the spires in side the glass encasings would start glowing.Supposedly from heat.
You could feel the ground rumble slightly.
it grows more and more in intensity.
And then, suddenly, complete silence.

You think something is broken for a second.
Shocked, you tap the screen a few times.
What if you broke it?
What if it's all gone now?
But all your worries are laid to rest as the screen regains its senses.
A few final lines of code come up before it spells 'Printing...'
And there, it comes out. A piece of paper.

You cannot understand what stands on it, but read it anyway.

You think that it's important to memorize it.
After looking at it and trying for a minute, you give up, though.
Begrudgingly, you simply rip out the paper.
You step away from the machine.
