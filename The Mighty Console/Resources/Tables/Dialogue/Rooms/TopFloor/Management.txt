You approach the door.
The closer you get to it, the clearer the room behind it appears to get.
Maybe it is simply a placebo.
But it doesn't matter.
You grab the handle and try to open.
It doesn't work. The door is shut.
You try again, this time more strongly.
The door gives off a nasty cracking sound and finally opens.
You do not expect it and fall inside with it.

If you thought the rest of this facility was silent, this room definitely is.
Sound padding decorates the walls' upper half.
The lower padded in insulation and wood.
What appears to be the head's office looks surprisingly clean.
As if you snapped and they jzst disappeared.

You get off your feet and brush the dust off your jeans.
Yet another desk.
Nothing on it, but it looks fancy.
Probably ebony wood.
And decorated with metal elements.
There definitely was a difference in status between whoever worked here and whoever directed this place.

A black leather seat stands behind the desk.
Sitting on it causes a clicking sound to come from the desk.
You are confused and get closer to the desk.
Moving your hand along the seams reveals a small drawer with a cigar inside it.
Some matches, a cutter, and an ashtray as well.
You decide to cut and light it.

...

You feel relaxed now, but the cigar is mostly gone now.
Had it burned more, you would have had to remove the sticker.
You don't like to do that.
So, you decide to put it on the ashtray.
You have never actually puffed cigars, but it is nice you think.
But you have spent enough time here.

Upon standing back up, the drawer closes.
You don't give it too much of a thought and go for the door.
With one last look back to the desk, you leave.
Once outside again, you move the door back into place, or rather attempt to.
It turns out you have to pull it with force.
But it's closed now.
And you back in the middle of the room.
