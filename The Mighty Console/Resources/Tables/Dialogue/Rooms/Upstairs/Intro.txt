Desks aligned in an array.
That's the first thing that comes to mind once you enter.
Not a bit like the regular office space.
Instead, it's a mix of that and lab equipment.
Petri dishes thrown on the ground, and microscopes with them.
One more room that looks as ransacked as the others.

All of the chairs are in random positions.
Some had been moved away from their desk.
Others had been thrown over or damaged.
And more stood neatly at their right place.
It's as if some quickly stood up and ran away and others just disappeared.
You feel as though someone might suddenly sit in one of them if you just look away briefly.

But there is more.
The walls are littered with desks containing various chemical containers and equipment.
Every single one had been ripped open, by force or not.
The contents splayed and shattered.
There's still a slight stench in the air, of compounds and death.

You remember chemistry class.
Way before you were ripped out of your ordinary life.
You never really liked chemistry.
To you, it seemed like just endless, senseless, formulaic formulas.
And more formulas.
Always formulas.
With no end in sight.
But it was peaceful.
Even though times now mostly are peaceful, too...
It's not the same.
