Despite knowing the overall look of the room, you decide to inspect it closer.
You don't know why, because you dislike the feeling here.
Yet something, like a voice, is moving you to do it anyway.
You look around the tables one by one.
Most of them were completely empty or useless, but a few contained something interesting.

One of them had an intact microscope still standing there.
It has a petri dish still on top.
You decide to look into it.
What you see shocks you.
There are moving things, bacteria, dust, and more.
You had never seen something like it.
They never gave you access to microscopes in school.
Since it was sizable but not too large, you contemplate taking it with you.
But you decide against it.

The second one strikes you as incredibly weird.
There is a note on there.
Most of it is completely incomprehensible, but you can make out some of it.
'There will be one.'
'War over.'
'Man scattered.'
'They are the key.'
You turn it around and almost fall into shock.
There is a drawing on there.
And despite the clearly shotty nature of it suggesting it had been made by an amateur...
It is you.
Or at least incredibly similar.

You feel odd.
Very odd.
