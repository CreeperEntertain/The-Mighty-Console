Comrade, I must insist - such an age is beyond reasonable limits.
The biological systems of humans are not designed to endure that long, and the data you've provided...

For your safety and clarity of records, I must refuse this input.
Please, adjust the age to a more plausible figure.
Efficiency demands truth.
