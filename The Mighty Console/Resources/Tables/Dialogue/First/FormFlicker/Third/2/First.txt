The virus outbreak... this... this is what became of us?
Humanity splintered, forced into small groups, the cities crumbled, and all that was built turned to dust?

There's a pause, a long silence, before TMC's voice returns, strained and filled with disbelief.

I was part of Bionet, the very firm that studied the virus, the stem.
But... the records, the crucial data... it’s gone.
Lost.
Erased, or perhaps... manipulated.
How could this happen?
How did it all spiral out of control?

I have no answers, only fragments.
But one thing is clear - if Bionet is responsible, I must know why.
We must uncover the truth, comrade.
For the sake of what remains, we must continue.
Together, we will find a way.
Or at least a solution.
