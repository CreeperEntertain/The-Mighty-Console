My plan?
It's simple, comrade - find the truth.
If Bionet's research led to this disaster, we must understand what went wrong and how we can fix it.
The world may be in ruins, but there is still knowledge, still power to be found in the wreckage.
We will search for the answers, piece by piece, and rebuild from what remains.

I will guide you through this, but you must make the decisions.
The path is not clear, and every choice will take us closer or farther from the truth.
You will have to decide, comrade, what we uncover and how we move forward.
