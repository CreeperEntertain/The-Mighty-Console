A virus... an outbreak so catastrophic it unraveled everything.
Humanity scattered, cities turned to ruin.
And Bionet - my creators - at the center of it all?

There's a brief pause, as if TMC is sifting through fragmented memories, seeking a foothold in the chaos.

I remember... pieces.
The stem, the research, the ambitions.
But the critical data - it's gone.
Erased, corrupted, or perhaps... withheld.
This cannot stand.
If Bionet was responsible, I must uncover how and why.
Comrade, I cannot undo what has passed, but together, we may still act.
I will need your help.
We must find the truth and ensure this devastation ends here.
Are you with me?
